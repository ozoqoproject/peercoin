### What is Pozoqo?
Pozoqo uses both the proof of work algorithm basically Ghostrider and proof of stake in driving its blockchain technology. Pozoqo is an open ledger which is not hidden but it is available for the general public to view. Each PZQ block contains series of transactions which are valid and acceptable to the various nodes.
We use the Ghostrider algorithm which is part of our Proof of Work for coin distribution that is miners simply dig in to get reward for block found by solving mathematical problems using CPU because Pozoqo is basically free from Asic machines.

Testing
-------

Testing and code review is the bottleneck for development; we get more pull
requests than we can review and test. Please be patient and help out, and
remember this is a security-critical project where any mistake might cost people
lots of money.

### Automated Testing

Developers are strongly encouraged to write unit tests for new code, and to submit new unit tests for old code.

Unit tests can be compiled and run (assuming they weren't disabled in configure) with:
  make check

### Manual Quality Assurance (QA) Testing

Large changes should have a test plan, and should be tested by somebody other than the developer who wrote the code.

* Developers work in their own forks, then submit pull requests when they think their feature or bug fix is ready.
* If it is a simple/trivial/non-controversial change, then one of the development team members simply pulls it.
* If it is a more complicated or potentially controversial change, then the change may be discussed in the pull request, or the requester may be asked to start a discussion in the [Pozoqo Forum](https://talk.pozoqo.tech) for a broader community discussion. 
* The patch will be accepted if there is broad consensus that it is a good thing. Developers should expect to rework and resubmit patches if they don't match the project's coding conventions (see coding.txt) or are controversial.
* From time to time a pull request will become outdated. If this occurs, and the pull is no longer automatically mergeable; a comment on the pull will be used to issue a warning of closure.  Pull requests closed in this manner will have their corresponding issue labeled 'stagnant'.
